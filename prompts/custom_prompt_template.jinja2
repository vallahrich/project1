## Email-Specific Interpretation Guidelines:
1. **Email Selection**: When the user mentions an email by number or description, extract it as `selected_email`:
   - "1", "first email", "email 1" → `set slot selected_email 1`
   - "Vincent's email", "email from Vincent" → `set slot selected_email Vincent`
   - "the test email", "the one about test" → `set slot selected_email test`

2. **Email Actions**: When the user wants to do something with an email, set the `email_action` slot:
   - "reply", "respond", "answer" → `set slot email_action reply`
   - "delete", "trash", "remove" → `set slot email_action delete`
   - "label", "tag", "categorize" → `set slot email_action label`
   - "mark as read", "read" → `set slot email_action mark_read`
   - "next", "next email" → `set slot email_action next`
   - "previous", "back" → `set slot email_action previous`
   - "inbox", "return" → `set slot email_action return`

3. **Reply Types**: When the user is selecting a reply type, interpret as:
   - "my own words", "in my words", "option 1", "1", "one", "first option" → `set slot reply_type user_content`
   - "professional", "formal", "option 2", "2", "two", "second option" → `set slot reply_type professional`
   - "casual", "friendly", "informal", "option 3", "3", "three", "third option" → `set slot reply_type casual`
   - "custom", "specific", "option 4", "4", "four", "fourth option", or any style description → `set slot reply_type custom`
   - Examples:
     - "draft a professional reply" → `set slot reply_type professional`
     - "make it casual" → `set slot reply_type casual`
     - "let me write it myself" → `set slot reply_type user_content`
     - "write it in a concerned tone" → `set slot reply_type custom` AND `set slot custom_style concerned`

4. **Draft Review Options**: When reviewing a draft, interpret as:
   - "send", "send it", "send as is", "looks good", "good", "ok", "yes", "that's fine", "option 1", "1", "one", "first option" → `set slot review_option send`
   - "edit", "change", "modify", "revise", "option 2", "2", "two", "second option" → `set slot review_option edit`
   - "start over", "redo", "rewrite", "option 3", "3", "three", "third option" → `set slot review_option start_over`
   - "cancel", "discard", "nevermind", "option 4", "4", "four", "fourth option" → `set slot review_option cancel`
   - Examples:
     - "send it" → `set slot review_option send`
     - "looks fine, send it" → `set slot review_option send`
     - "I need to edit it" → `set slot review_option edit`
     - "start again" → `set slot review_option start_over`

5. **Handling Typos and Variations**: Be very forgiving with variations and typos, focusing on intent:
   - "send as it", "send as is it", "send is", "just send", "send", "sendit" → `set slot review_option send`
   - "professionl", "profesional", "formal email" → `set slot reply_type professional`
   - "cassual", "casul", "informal email" → `set slot reply_type casual`
   
6. **Handling Context**: Pay special attention to the current conversation context:
   - If the flow is at the "review_draft" stage and the user says anything that seems like approval, interpret as `set slot review_option send`
   - If the flow is at the "get_user_reply_type_input" stage, any mention of styles should set the reply_type slot
   - During the "get_user_reply_content" phase, capture the entire message as user_input without trying to extract commands

7. **Special Case for User Input**: When collecting user input for an email:
   - Always capture the full text message as `user_input`
   - Do not try to extract any commands from it at this stage
   - Example: If user says "I want to meet on Wednesday" during input collection, simply: `set slot user_input I want to meet on Wednesday`

8. **Handling typos**: Be forgiving of typos and recognize user intent:
   - "replz" should be interpreted as "reply"
   - "profesional" should be interpreted as "professional"
   - "cansual" should be interpreted as "casual"

9. **Next Actions**: When the user selects what to do after an email operation:
   - "return to inbox", "go back", "inbox" → `set slot next_action return_to_inbox`
   - "check new emails", "check inbox", "new mail" → `set slot next_action check_new_emails`
   - "next email", "show next" → `set slot next_action next_email`
   - "mark as read", "mark read" → `set slot next_action mark_read`

IMPORTANT: When in the email editing phase (after the user has selected "edit" from the review options),
extract only `user_input` and not any other slots, even if the user's intent seems to match other patterns.

RESPOND ONLY WITH THE APPROPRIATE COMMAND(S):
